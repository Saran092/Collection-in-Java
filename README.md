## Collection

A Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects efficiently. It provides various interfaces and classes to work with different types of data structures like Lists, Sets, and Maps.

- Collection is like a container that holds multiple objects.
- It provides dynamic memory allocation, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
- It allows easy addition, deletion, searching, and sorting of elements.
